# WEB-scraping-and-APIs

🎯 Project Overview

The e-scooter-sharing startup Gans aspires to operate in the most populous cities all around the world. Scooter movements are strongly influenced by weather conditions and arrivals of people in close-by airports. 
The aim of the project was to collect weather data in order to help the startup predict the scooters' movements and flights' information.

We create therefore a pipeline that extracts data from 3 different sources, one will be web scrapping (to get latitude and longitude of the cities) and the other two (weather and flights infos) will be APIs. 

This data is transformed using Python and finally, the data will be stored in a SQL database.
